# Personal Marlin firmware configurations

These are the [Marlin firmware](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) configurations for my two 3D printers:

* [Creality Ender 3 v2](https://www.finnie.org/2024/05/11/the-printer-formerly-known-as-ender/)
* [Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus](https://www.finnie.org/2019/05/04/monoprice-maker-select-plus-3d-printer-mods/)

Note that my printers have been so heavily modified that they only barely resemble their original printers. You should not use these configurations directly on your own printer.
